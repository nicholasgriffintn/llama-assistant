With increasing pressure from tech giants in the video-on-demand and audio-streaming markets, the BBC holds strong and strives in its offering to the audience. With the continued evolution of its most renowned technology product, BBC iPlayer and the addition of BBC Sounds to its product offering, the BBC is not only ensuring it has a place in the future but is also paving the way in the technology space. These products not only serve millions of users every week, being there when the audience needs them the most but they are also ever more relevant and personalised for each of us. The world-class team driving this innovation continues to push forward new ways, like the use of UHD (ultra high definition) or the fact that its products’ resilience and quality is second to none, making sure these products work, always. The technology innovation driven from within the BBC, not only pushes others to do more but also to do better. All this driven by the same goal to continue to inform, educate and entertain this varied audience.

We live in a new, high tech world in which this centenary public organisation is still pushing the boundaries for the audience’s benefit, leading in new and innovative ways, not only by producing great content but also by creating software products that match that same level of excellence.
