## Examples and Evidence

Here are some examples from the text that illustrate the neutral tone and lack of political alignment:

> Dame Priti is the first woman to throw her hat into the ring to replace Rishi Sunak, and joins James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, Tom Tugendhat and Mel Stride.

> She has been a backbench MP since stepping down as home secretary in 2022, following the resignation of her ally Boris Johnson.

> Dame Priti has been highly critical of the Conservative Party's leadership in recent years, blaming them for the Tories' slide from political favour that culminated in July's historic election defeat.

> She also said that it would be through focusing on conservative policies on issues including law and order, immigration and healthcare that would reverse the party's fortunes.

> Dame Priti, who retained her seat in the Essex constituency of Witham in the recent general election, is a Eurosceptic who was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum.

> She has also faced allegations of bullying. In 2020, a Cabinet Office inquiry into her conduct found that Ms Patel had "unintentionally" breached the ministerial code in her behaviour towards
