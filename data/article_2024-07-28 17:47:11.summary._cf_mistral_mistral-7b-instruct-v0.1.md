 ## Article Summary: Reeves to Reveal Public Finance Shortfall

### Introduction
The new Labour Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is set to present an audit of public spending to Parliament, revealing a significant financial challenge for the government. The audit is expected to show a "black hole" in the public finances, potentially worth tens of billions of pounds.
